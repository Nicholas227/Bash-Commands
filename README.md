# Bash-Commands
This repository contains some simple bash files I've created for my own personal use, I'll keep a running inventory as I continue to expand. 

Theres 3 main types of files I've made so far, a few learning files, some commands that interface with OS X applications, and some customizations of my PS1 (terminal setup) environment variable.
Bash Command for shortcuts and saving time
How To:
1. Create a file in TextEdit, convert to plain text, and save without a .txt extension
2. Code in bash
3. In terminal, cd to root directory (~)
4. ls -a to see names of bash profiles or bashrc
5. Open bashrc or bash profile depending on your setup
6. Create a new alias e.g. alias print-hello='/Users/nick/Documents/FirstScript'
7. Source the bash file
8. Run the command
(Optionally, for applescript commands for OS users, you may use osascript and create files with a .applescript extension)
